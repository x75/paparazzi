Paparazzi 4.0
=============

Changes since old_master tag

General
-------

- Settings for the telemetry modes are automatically generated from the XML file
  [#118] (https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/pull/118)
- Documentation node for modules
  [#182] (https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/pull/182)
- Automatic conversion of units in airframe file, settings and messages.
  See http://paparazzi.enac.fr/wiki/Units
- Fix rc_settings: this enables you to change some settings in flight
  directly from the RC, is useful if you are alone or don't have a GCS.
- Prefer compiler found in PATH over /opt/paparazzi/arm-multilib
  [#231] (https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/issues/231)
- Usability improvements for calibration scripts and
  added 3D view of magnetometer data with fitted ellipsoid

    - Correction of centrifugal acceleration
    - Proper handling of BODY_TO_IMU rotations
- All status LEDs configurable (with sensible defaults for the boards):
  SYS_TIME_LED, AHRS_ALIGNER_LED, BARO_LED, GPS_LED, RADIO_CONTROL_LED
- Possibility to use two 2-way switches for the mode instead of one 3-way switch
- GPS NMEA parser usable for basic position and fix

Rotorcraft firmware specific
----------------------------

- Stabilization/supervision commands with standard PPRZ range
  [#169] (https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/pull/169)
- Additional motor arming options
  [#174] (https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/pull/174)
